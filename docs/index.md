# OpenStackGateway

Compute provider API for UCloud

## Overview

![Overview](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aau-claaudia/OpenStackGateway/provider-support/docs/diagrams/overview.iuml)

This service facilitates communication between UCloud and Claaudia OpenStack.
In UCloud terms, this is a compute provider, that provides a compute service to UCloud.
It is a stateless service with an API based on this example:
[UCloud Spring Boot Example](https://github.com/SDU-eScience/UCloud/tree/master/provider-integration/spring-boot-example)

It implements this interface: [JvmProviderSupport](https://github.com/SDU-eScience/UCloud/tree/master/backend/jvm-provider-support) 

See UClouds [Compute Provider Documentation](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/dev/backend/app-orchestrator-service/wiki/provider.html#authentication-and-authorization)


## Documentation
[Service documentation on code level](code)

This documentation is generated with [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka):

`./gradlew dokkaGfm`

## Technology
The service is built with Kotlin and Spring Boot. 
It uses the gradle build tool 


## Swagger
The swagger ui can be reached at the base url.
Authentication is enabled, and a Bearer token can be added using the "Authorize" button.
The API can also be tested directly with cURL.
The autogenerated requests for many of the endpoints cannot be shown. 
I have included examples of requests [here](src/test/resources/requests/create-job.json) 
to test the provider API.

For the manual insertion endpoint there is an example [here](src/test/resources/requests/temp-job-request-example.json).

## Athentication and Authorization

UCloud and the provider
This is handled by UClouds provider integration module: [Jvm-Provider-Support](https://github.com/SDU-eScience/UCloud/tree/master/backend/jvm-provider-support)
A certificate and a refresh_token is added to the config and used to authenticate 
the provider integration module on inbound and outbound requests.
See more here: [UCloud Compute Providers](https://github.com/SDU-eScience/UCloud/tree/master/provider-integration/integration-module)

## API

The gateway currently exposes the following endpoints for ucloud:

### Create
Start one or more compute jobs by creating stacks in openstack

One or more jobs are received from ucloud and is assumed to be ready to start.
The ucloud jobs are converted to openstack stack format and sent to openstack.
Without waiting for the stacks to start respond to ucloud.

A monitoring thread is started for each stack that will send a status update to ucloud when you stack has successfully started or failed.

#### Delete
Deletes one or more compute jobs by deleting stacks in OpenStack

The corresponding stacks are found in OpenStack and delete requests are sent
The provider should not only stop the compute job but also delete
    * _compute_ related resources. For example, if the job is a virtual machine job, the underlying machine
    * should also be deleted. None of the resources attached to the job, however, should be deleted.

# Openstack compute flavors
The general compute flavors are based on deic's type1 descriptions available [somewhere](somewhere).

GPU instances are based on our current hardware,
machines with six t4 GPUs, 256GB memory,
and 64 vCPUs (2x16 core EPYCs).

Storage is based on whatever we did on our old OpenStack platform.

Pricing is just an example

Name | vCPU | RAM | Volatile Storage | GPU | Price
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
uc-general-small | 4 vCPU | 16 Gb | 1 Tb | N/A | 0.34 DKK/hour
uc-general-medium | 8 vCPU | 32 Gb | 1 Tb | N/A | 0.68 DKK/hour
uc-general-large | 16 vCPU | 64 Gb | 1 Tb | N/A | 1.37 DKK/hour
uc-general-xlarge | 64 vCPU | 256 Gb | 1 Tb | N/A | 5.50 DKK/hour
uc-t4-1 | 10 vCPU | 40 Gb | 1 Tb | T4 16 Gb | 8.50 DKK/hour
